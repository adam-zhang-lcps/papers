\begin{paper}
  In 2017, \citeauthor{Shusterman2017:Scythe} published \book, a dystopian novel
  exploring a post-mortality and post-government world. In \book, society has
  essentially reached perfection, and, with the exception of a single
  organization, is entirely managed by a ``perfect'' superintelligence known as
  the Thunderhead. The single organization not under the Thunderhead's
  jurisdiction is the Scythedom, an organization responsible for ensuring people
  still die in a world of immortals, for overpopulation is still an issue with
  no better solution. Its members are known as Scythes, the upper echelons of
  society's empathy and frugality.

  The central plot of the story revolves around Citra Terranova and Rowan
  Damisch, who inadvertently become part of a competition against each other to
  achieve Scythehood, in the midst of rising factions and organizational
  concerns within the larger Scythedom body.

  \book{} was a large commercial success; currently, it sits at approximately
  363,000 ratings on \citeauthor{Goodreads2016:Scythe}, along with earning a
  nomination for the ``Readers' Favorite Young Adult Fantasy \& Science
  Fiction'' award in 2017. \book{} also earned a spot on TIME's top 100 young
  adult books [citation needed: https://time.com/collection/100-best-ya-books/].
