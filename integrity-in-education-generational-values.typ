I have attended the ACL for the past three years of my education. The ACL is a magnet school---a school for the "academically talented" and "gifted" students among us @Nadler2016:NewEngineerMagnetCompletesLongtimeAcademiesVision. Classes are small and compartmentalized, so becoming acquainted with everyone that typically surrounded me was not a particularly hard nor time-consuming task.

The ACL is known, especially by its students, for having an extraordinarily stringent and visible honor code---"On my honor, I will not accept nor provide any unauthorized aid on any test, quiz, or assignment." This honor code is prominently displayed upon a wall in every classroom, and is even visible on some walls in the hallway. Most teachers require the honor code to be signed on every major assessment.

Yet, despite the remarkable exhortation of the honor code throughout the ACL, I have witnessed countless instances of evident academic dishonesty---or, colloquially, "cheating"---throughout my years of attendance. Now, the magnitude of academic dishonesty varied greatly---some were insignificant, others were much more serious. Two instances within my class throughout my junior year garnered significant attention and academic consequences---one of those instances actually involved a report made by me.

Now, I won't pretend to be some moral angel, incapable of doing wrong and relentlessly shunning others for their sins---after all, I have engaged in my fair share of minor honesty violations as well. However, I would like to believe that I have had enough integrity to keep myself out of major incidents and, for the most part, refused to break the honor code. I only wonder: why is academic dishonesty so prevalent? Why are students so willing to sacrifice their integrity? And, most importantly, how did we get here? // epic Minecraft reference ðŸ’¥

Integrity is widely regarded as one of the most important moral characteristics. John Paddock Jr., a baby boomer, has had a long career, having been involved in various defense sectors, a long time of service in the military, and successful entrepreneurial ventures. In an interview, he detailed his long history of leadership roles. When asked about the most valuable advice for "effective leadership", he asserted that "character and integrity count---a lot "@Morelli2024:JohnPaddockJr. This lines up with general sentiments---in fact, all generations hold integrity as a value in high regard @Riza2020:HowDifferenGenerationApproachProfessionEthics. However, younger generations also value individualism and personal gain highly. Thus, in spite of the value of integrity, research has found that younger generation are more likely to compromise their values in the face of possible consequence---for example, younger workers are likelier to break the rules when "pressured by others", such as their boss or employer @Center2013:GenerationDifferenWorkplacEthics.

How does this affect education? Allow me to introduce Dr. Gerald Shapiro, whom I interviewed due to his unique perspective on academic integrity, being both a longtime student and longtime teacher. Dr. Shapiro was born in the 1950s, a member of the "baby boomer" generation, and has been teaching at the high school and university level for multiple decades @Najib2024:YourGreatestGenBeta. When asked about his own education, Dr. Shapiro asserted that he never performed acts of academic dishonesty, nor did he assist others in doing so. However, he did note that he had friends that would sometimes "ask me if I could do something for them", but respected his refusal.
