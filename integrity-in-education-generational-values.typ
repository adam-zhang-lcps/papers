I have attended the ACL for the past three years of my education. The ACL is a magnet school---a school for the "academically talented" and "gifted" students among us @Nadler2016:NewEngineerMagnetCompletesLongtimeAcademiesVision. Classes are small and compartmentalized, so becoming acquainted with everyone that typically surrounded me was not a particularly hard nor time-consuming task.

The ACL is known, especially by its students, for having an extraordinarily stringent and visible honor code---"On my honor, I will not accept nor provide any unauthorized aid on any test, quiz, or assignment." This honor code is prominently displayed upon a wall in every classroom, and is even visible on some walls in the hallway. Most teachers require the honor code to be signed on every major assessment.

Yet, despite the remarkable exhortation of the honor code throughout the ACL, I have witnessed countless instances of evident academic dishonesty---or, colloquially, "cheating"---throughout my years of attendance. Now, the magnitude of academic dishonesty varied greatly---some were insignificant, others were much more serious. Two instances within my class throughout my junior year garnered significant attention and academic consequences---one of those instances actually involved a report made by me.

Now, I won't pretend to be some moral angel, incapable of doing wrong and relentlessly shunning others for their sins---after all, I have engaged in my fair share of minor honesty violations as well. However, I would like to believe that I have had enough integrity to keep myself out of major incidents and, for the most part, refused to break the honor code. I only wonder: why is academic dishonesty so prevalent? Why are students so willing to sacrifice their integrity? And, most importantly, how did we get here? // epic Minecraft reference ðŸ’¥

Integrity is widely regarded as one of the most important moral characteristics. John Paddock Jr., a baby boomer, has had a long career, having been involved in various defense sectors, a long time of service in the military, and successful entrepreneurial ventures. In an interview, he detailed his long history of leadership roles. When asked about the most valuable advice for "effective leadership", he asserted that "character and integrity count---a lot "@Morelli2024:JohnPaddockJr. This lines up with general sentiments---in fact, all generations hold integrity as a value in high regard @Riza2020:HowDifferenGenerationApproachProfessionEthics. However, younger generations also value individualism and personal gain highly. Thus, in spite of the value of integrity, research has found that younger generation are more likely to compromise their values in the face of possible consequence---for example, younger workers are likelier to break the rules when "pressured by others", such as their boss or employer @Center2013:GenerationDifferenWorkplacEthics.

How does this affect education? Allow me to introduce Dr. Gerald Shapiro, whom I interviewed due to his unique perspective on academic integrity, being both a longtime student and longtime teacher. Dr. Shapiro was born in the 1950s, making him a member of the "baby boomer" generation @Najib2024:YourGreatestGenBeta. He has been teaching at the high school and university level for multiple decades, and currently teaches multiple computer science classes at the ACL.

When asked about his own education, Dr. Shapiro asserted that he never performed acts of academic dishonesty, nor did he assist others in doing so, for he "value[d] honesty and integrity and I wouldn't compromise my own, even for my friends"---a consistent perspective from the older generations. However, he did note that he had friends that would sometimes "ask me if I could do something [academically dishonest] for them", but they always respected his refusal.

On the other hand, from the perspective of a teacher, Dr. Shapiro claimed that he had some "definite cases" of academic dishonesty throughout his years of teaching. When asked whether he believes the "pattern of cheating" has changed throughout generations, he stated he believes the pattern has not changed---"students who are struggling try to get help" and, when assistance is not provided, turn to cheating to ensure success instead.

This brings up a key insight: while the reason that students choose to be academically dishonest---success---hasn't changed, the pressure to succeed has---dramatically. Dr. Shapiro emphasized this dichotomy, saying "the grades aren't the point, except that the grades are the point". I'm intimately familiar with this pressure myself---the ACL is extremely academically competitive; as Dr. Shapiro describes, "courses are harder, the expectations are higher, and students in this academy are not
generally used to being academically challenged because they've been at the top of their class throughout their careers and they're used to getting really good grades and there might be a lot of pressure at home to continue that."

Another experience to examine is that of Mr. Douglas Anderson, current principal of Riverside High School and a member of the older Generation X. When questioned about his education, he said he experienced "zero academic pressure", and, in fact, put in minimal effort until becoming an upperclassman in high school---a stark contrast to the experiences of many teens today.

Indeed, academic pressure across generations has soared dramatically. Young generations today, especially those at "high-achieving schools" such as the ACL, are increasingly pressured to perform well in school to have a "secure" and "successful" future. These pressures are only amplified by trends such as grade inflation, increasing college tuition and decreasing acceptable rates, and higher job competitiveness in popular fields. High academic pressure can be deeply psychologically stressful---it's been correlated with increasing depression, anxiety, and suicide rates in today's youth @Cvhsolympian2018:Increasin @Lens2022:HowTodayHighSchoolStudentsFace @Baker2018:IsGradeInflation.

Thus, what are today's students to do when struggling to succeed amidst extreme pressure to do so? Well, it may seem a natural decision as a student to simply decide to cheat. This decision is made even easier by the broad accessibility today's students have to modern tools and technology. Both Dr. Shapiro and Mr. Anderson agree that cheating in school today would be easier than during their time in school, citing changes such as the increased usage of technology for assignments making it easier to copy a friend's work, the pertinence of out-of-class assignments hurting teachers' ability to monitor their students, the ease of communication with friends to share work, and the rise of AI- or LLM-powered tools making it even harder to detect cheating. The data supports their beliefs---59% of surveyed students said it was "significantly easier" to cheat in an online setting than in-person @Wiley2023:NewInsightsAcademicIntegrit. LLMs, a relatively recent technology, are especially troublesome, as students can easily utilize them to generate writing "coherent enough for it not to be detected by academic staff members" @Perkins2023:AcademicIntegritAiLargeLanguageModels.

Generations may not have changed in their value of integrity, but younger generations certainly have other concerns as well. A culture emphasizing individualism and personal success has surely contributed to a concerning trend of increasing academic pressure. With increasing academic pressure coming increasingly distressed students, stretched thinner and further towards the breaking point. Hence, to avoid reaching that point, students choose to be academically dishonest just to survive their harsh environment. Combine that situation with the increasingly wide swath of opportunities and methods to cheat, and it's no wonder that today's students are more willing to sacrifice such an important moral.
