I have attended the ACL for the past three years of my education. ACL is a magnet school#CNâ€”a school for the "academically talented" and "gifted" students among us. Classes are small and compartmentalized, so becoming acquainted with everyone that typically surrounded me was not a particularly hard nor time-consuming task.

ACL is known, especially by its students, for having an extraordinarily stringent and visible honor codeâ€”"On my honor, I will not accept nor provide any unauthorized aid on any test, quiz, or assignment."#CN This honor code is prominently displayed upon a wall in every classroom, and is even visible on some walls in the hallway. Most teachers require the honor code to be signed on every major assessment.

Yet, despite the remarkable exhortation of the honor code throughout ACL, I have witnessed countless instances of evident academic dishonestyâ€”or, colloquially, "cheating"â€”throughout my years of attendance. Now, the magnitude of academic dishonesty varied greatlyâ€”some were insignificant, others were much more serious. Two instances within my class throughout my junior year garnered significant attention and academic consequencesâ€”one of those instances actually involved a report made by me.

Now, I won't pretend to be some moral angel, incapable of doing wrong and relentlessly shunning others for their sinsâ€”after all, I have engaged in my fair share of minor honesty violations as well. However, I would like to believe that I have had enough integrity to keep myself out of major incidents and, for the most part, refused to break the honor code. I only wonder: how did we get here/* epic Minecraft reference ðŸ’¥ */? Why is academic dishonesty so prevalent? Why are students so willing to sacrifice their integrity?

Integrity is widely regarded as one of the most important moral characteristics#CN. However, its presence in education and student bodies is often lower than in other fields due to academic pressures#CN. Thus it may be useful to investigate how the value of integrity within education has changed over time, especially throughout generations that may have valued both integrity and academic success with differing weight.

In an interview, Dr. Gerald Shapiro offered his unique perspective on academic integrity through both the lens of students and teachers. Dr. Shapiro was born in the 1950s, a member of the "baby boomer" generation#CN, and has been teaching at the high school and university level for multiple decades. When asked about his own education, Dr. Shapiro asserted that he never performed acts of academic dishonesty, nor did he assist others in doing so. However, he did note that he had friends that would sometimes "ask me if I could do something for them", but respected his refusal.
