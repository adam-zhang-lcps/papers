Integrity is widely regarded as one of the most important moral characteristics#CN. However, its presence in education and student bodies is often lower than in other fields due to academic pressures#CN. Thus it may be useful to investigate how the value of integrity within education has changed over time, especially throughout generations that may have valued both integrity and academic success with differing weight.

In an interview, Dr. Gerald Shapiro offered his unique perspective on academic integrity through both the lens of students and teachers. Dr. Shapiro was born in the 1950s, a member of the "baby boomer" generation#CN, and has been teaching at the high school and university level for multiple decades. When asked about his own education, Dr. Shapiro asserted that he never performed acts of academic dishonesty, nor did he assist others in doing so. However, he did note that he had friends that would sometimes "ask me if I could do something for them", but respected his refusal.
