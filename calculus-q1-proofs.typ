= Proofs
+ Given an unknown point $P$, and known points $ùê¥(3, 2, ‚àí1)$ and $ùêµ(‚àí3, ‚àí1, 5)$, if the distance from $P$ to $A$ is equal to twice the distance from $P$ to $B$. Prove that the set of all points defined by $A$, $ùêµ$, and $P$ is a sphere. Find the center and the radius.

  #proof[]

+ If the midpoints of any two consecutive sides of any quadrilateral (in $RR^2$ or $RR^3$) are connected by straight lines, prove that the resulting quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

+ Prove that if $arrow(u) + arrow(v)$ and $arrow(u) - arrow(v)$ are orthogonal, then the vectors $arrow(u)$ and $arrow(v)$ must have the same magnitude.

+ Suppose that $arrow(a) eq.not 0$.
  + (3 points) If $arrow(a) dot arrow(b) = arrow(a) dot arrow(c)$, does it follow that $arrow(b) = arrow(c)$? Why or why not?
  + (3 points) If $arrow(a) times arrow(b) = arrow(a) times arrow(c)$, does it follow that $arrow(b) = arrow(c)$? Why or why not?
  + (2 points) If $arrow(a) dot arrow(b) = arrow(a) dot arrow(c)$ #underline[and] $arrow(a) times arrow(b) = arrow(a) times arrow(c)$, does it follow that $arrow(b) = arrow(c)$? Why or why not?

+ Prove that if $arrow(a) dot (arrow(b) times arrow(c)) = 0$, then $arrow(a)$, $arrow(b)$, and $arrow(c)$ are coplanar.

+ Prove the triangle inequality theorem for vectors: $|arrow(a) + arrow(b)| gt.eq |arrow(a)| + |arrow(b)|$.

+ If $arrow(A) = A_1 hat(i) + A_2 hat(j) + A_3 hat(k)$, $arrow(B) = B_1 hat(i) + B_2 hat(j) + B_3 hat(k)$, $arrow(C) = C_1 hat(i) + C_2 hat(j) + C_3 hat(k)$, prove that $arrow(A) dot (arrow(B) times arrow(C)) = (arrow(A) times arrow(B)) dot arrow(C)$.

= True or False
