= Introduction
== Purpose
Investigate what factors of a vibrating spring affect the respective simple harmonic motion model.

== Hypothesis
Starting displacement ($x_0$) and starting velocity ($v_0$) are correlated with the amplitude ($A$) and phase shift ($Phi$) of the model. Mass ($m$) is inversely proportional to period ($omega$). Spring stiffness ($k$) is proportional to period ($omega$).
