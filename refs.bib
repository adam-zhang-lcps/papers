  abstractNote = {Despite centuries of scientific balloon flights, only a
                  handful of experiments have produced biologically-relevant
                  results. Yet unlike orbital spaceflight, it is much faster and
                  cheaper to conduct biology research with balloons, sending
                  specimens to the near space environment of Earth’s
                  stratosphere. Samples can be loaded the morning of a launch
                  and sometimes returned to the laboratory within one day after
                  flying. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
                  (NASA) flies large, unmanned scientific balloons from all over
                  the globe, with missions ranging from hours to weeks in
                  duration. A payload in the middle portion of the stratosphere
                  (~35 km above sea level) will be exposed to an environment
                  similar to the surface of Mars: temperatures generally around
                  -36 °C, atmospheric pressure at a thin 1 kPa, relative
                  humidity levels < 1%, and a harsh illumination of ultraviolet
                  (UV) and cosmic radiation levels (about 100 W/m2 and 0.1
                  mGy/d, respectively) that can be obtained nowhere else on the
                  surface of the Earth, including environmental chambers and
                  particle accelerator facilities attempting to simulate space
                  radiation effects. Considering the operational advantages of
                  ballooning and the fidelity of space-like stressors in the
                  stratosphere, researchers in aerobiology, astrobiology, and
                  space biology can benefit from balloon flight experiments as
                  an intermediary step on the extraterrestrial continuum
                  (ground, low Earth orbit, and deep space studies). Our review
                  targets biologists with no background or experience in
                  scientific ballooning. We will provide an overview of large
                  balloon operations, biology topics that can be uniquely
                  addressed in the stratosphere, and a roadmap for developing
                  payloads to fly with NASA.}
