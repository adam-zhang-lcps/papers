This repository contains the [[https://typst.app][Typst]]/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX][LaTeX]] sources for my formal academic papers (and sometimes informal assignments as well ðŸ™ƒ).

* Obtaining Compiled PDFs ðŸ“„
** From Index
An index of all documents is available [[https://adam-zhang-lcps.github.io/papers/][here]] and updated automatically on every commit. PDFs can be saved using the browser's download functionality (which is probably =Control + S=).

Historical copies of the index can be obtained from the "Publish PDF index" GitHub Actions workflows under the =github-pages= artifact.

** From GitHub Actions
*Note: GitHub will only allow you to download the artifact if you're signed in!*

A GitHub Actions workflow runs on every push commit and uploads a compiled PDF as an artifact. Either click [[https://github.com/adam-zhang-lcps/papers/actions][the "Actions" tab]] to find the workflow for a specific commit, or look in [[https://github.com/adam-zhang-lcps/papers/commits/main][the commit history]] for checkmarks.

On the dashboard, select the "Build Changed Typst Files" action, choose a commit, and then download the =pdf= artifact at the bottom of the page.

** Compiling Manually
To compile PDFs locally, you will need to install either [[https://typst.app][Typst]] (releases are available [[https://github.com/typst/typst/releases][here]]) or a [[https://tug.org/texlive/][TeXLive distribution]] (note that, while others compilers will likely also work, I compile with LuaLaTeX). Alternatively, you can enter a development shell using [[https://nixos.org][Nix]] with ~nix develop~, which comes with both the Typst compiler as well as a TeXLive environment containing LuaLaTeX as well as all packages used.

Once installed, compiling documents is as simple as running the appropriate compiler:
#+begin_src shell
  # To compile Typst documents
  typst c document.typ

  # To compile LaTeX documents
  latexmk -lualatex document.tex
#+end_src
