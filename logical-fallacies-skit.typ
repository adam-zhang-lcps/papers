#character[Bartender]
#dialogue[Hey guys, welcome in, take a seat wherever!]

#direction[BARTENDER comes over from serving ADAMâ€™s 2nd soju glass of the night.]

#character[Bartender]
#direction[Wipes glass with rag.]
#dialogue[What can I get you started with for today?]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[Iâ€™ll take a glass of apple juice and a Caesar salad to start with, thank you.]

#character[Bartender]
#dialogue[What about you, maâ€™am?]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Iâ€™ll have a Shirley Temple and some bone-in wings.]

#direction[BARTENDER prepares their drinks.]

#character[Bartender]
#dialogue[Alright, here are your drinks, Iâ€™ll grab those dishes for you from the kitchen.]

#direction[BARTENDER walks out of scene.]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[You shouldnâ€™t have ordered that, those wings are horrible for your health, theyâ€™ll give you a heart attack and youâ€™ll die. (slippery slope)]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Well, I eat wings every day and havenâ€™t died yet so they must be healthy. (anecdotal fallacy)]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[Wings arenâ€™t healthy, and they arenâ€™t even that good, theyâ€™re average at best, the salad is way better. (Tu Quoque, pt. 1) Maybe if you started eating healthy youâ€™d actually grow to a reasonable height. (Ad hominem)]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Wow, are you saying you hate all short people? Short people can be just as healthy as everyone else. (straw man) Also, didnâ€™t you used to eat wings all the time? (Tu Quoque, pt. 2)]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[Maybe, but donâ€™t you do hard drugs everyday? Just because it hasnâ€™t killed you doesn't mean it's healthy?]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Okay and? Everyone does hard drugs these days, you should try it too sometime! (Bandwagon)]

#character[Adam]
#dialogue[Yeah what she said!]
#direction[ADAM passes out on the table.]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[Look at him, heâ€™s a drunk and depressed broke alcoholic with no scholarships and 200k in student loans, him agreeing proves nothing!]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Yeah but heâ€™s a PhD student at MIT, he must be right! (appeal to authority)]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[Does PhD stand for "possibly high and drunk"? (Ad hominem)]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Hey, the bartenderâ€™s coming back, letâ€™s ask her to weigh in!]

#direction[BARTENDER returns with the food ordered earlier.]

#character[Bartender]
#dialogue[Havenâ€™t you people ever had the decency to consider running on a treadmill while watching the Super Bowl?! (red herring) Being active while watching TV is obviously the best, that's why everyone should workout while watching the Super Bowl. (circular argument)]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[Even the bartender agrees, running and salad are both healthy for you. Therefore salad is better than wings! (false equivalence)]

#character[Bartender]
#dialogue[Salad and wings arenâ€™t a great comparison either. One is fried finger food and the other is a healthy dish. Besides, Iâ€™ve never had a bad experience with any Super Bowl food before, itâ€™s always tasty and perfect. (hasty generalization)]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Our argument is valid since wings are just like salads. You eat them both during the super bowl. (weak analogy)]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[I still believe salad is better. Last year, I ate salad at my Super Bowl party, and my team won. Therefore, salad is better than wings and eating it helps them win. (false cause)]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Fine, salads are okay, but wings are a gift from nature. Who can deny that? (appeal to ignorance)]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[Salads are more of a gift of nature than wings. They literally come straight from the Earth. Also, you canâ€™t say salads are bad and then say theyâ€™re okay a few minutes later. You either hate salads or you love them. Pick a side! (false dilemma)]

#direction[BARTENDER walks away, notices ADAM asleep, and shakes ADAM awake.]

#character[Adam]
#direction[groggy]
#dialogue[What?]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Well, Iâ€™ve already ordered the wings, so itâ€™d be a waste to not eat them. (sunk cost)]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[Whatever, I'm going to the bathroom.]

#direction[DIEGO leaves to use the restroom. TAYLOR, still frustrated, looks around and notices ADAM again.]

#character[Taylor]
#direction[shaking head]
#dialogue[If he really cared about the environment he wouldnâ€™t waste food. (emotional appeal)]

#direction[ADAM slowly stirs and rubs his eyes.]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Adam, would you like a wing? Maybe youâ€™ll find them worthy of Super Bowl status unlike someone.]

#character[Adam]
#direction[yawning]
#dialogue[No, I think Iâ€™ll throw up if I eat anything. Thanks though. What were you two arguing about so loudly anyway?]

#character[Taylor]
#dialogue[Diego thinks that salad is better than chicken wings! Like, lettuce and cucumbers are disgusting, why would anyone eat salad? (composition fallacy)]

#direction[Diego returns from the restroom.]

#character[Adam]
#dialogue[Uh, I think thatâ€™s a fallacious argument...]

#character[Diego]
#dialogue[HA, youâ€™re wrong Taylor! (fallacy fallacy)]

#direction[In the background, the Super Bowl Halftime Show is beginning on the televisions around the bar.]

#character[Bartender]
#dialogue[Hey you three, no more bickering, the halftime show is starting!]

#direction[Fade to black and end scene. On a black screen, the message "Every food is good food. Enjoy the game." is displayed while "Not Like Us" by Kendrick Lamar plays in the background.]
