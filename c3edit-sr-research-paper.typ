= Abstract
Most programmers have editors that they strongly prefer to use over others. With the wide array of choice available within the code editor ecosystem, it is natural that there is a wide variety of code editors in use, with differing levels of specialization, customizability, power, robustness, extensibility, and ease-of-use. While this is no problem for writing and sharing code through other tools such as Git, it means that live cross-editor collaborative editing is impossible. Many editors have live collaborative editing features available, but such solutions only work across the same editor, making it difficult for a team of diverse programmers to utilize together. Thus, just like how collaboration via Git is possible via an external program, I aim to build an external program capable of communication with various thin front-ends implemented for each editor to allow for cross-editor live collaborative editing.

= Problem
Most programmers have editors that they strongly prefer to use over others. With the wide array of choice available within the code editor ecosystem, it is natural that there is a wide variety of code editors in use, with differing levels of specialization, customizability, power, robustness, extensibility, and ease-of-use. The large variety of editors in use means that real-time collaborative editing is usually not an option for team programming, since there is no way to engage in live editing across editors.
